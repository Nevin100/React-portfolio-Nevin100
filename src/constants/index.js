export const HERO_CONTENT = `I am a passionate Full Stack Developer actively building scalable and modern web applications using the MERN stack. On the frontend, I specialize in React.js with TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS, crafting responsive and dynamic user experiences. On the backend, I work with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (with Mongoose ODM), and Prisma, and I‚Äôm also exploring PostgreSQL with Neon for advanced data handling. I have experience implementing authentication, secure APIs, and third-party integrations like Firebase and Cloudinary. Additionally, I bring analytical skills in Data Analysis using Python and Excel, along with dashboarding and insights visualization using Power BI.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hi, I‚Äôm Nevin Bali ‚Äî a tech enthusiast, problem solver, and passionate full stack developer who finds joy in building products that are both functional and beautiful.

üéì I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science at MSIT (2023‚Äì2027), and already diving deep into real-world development. From crafting scalable APIs to designing pixel-perfect UIs, I enjoy the full journey from backend logic to frontend delight.

‚öôÔ∏è My stack? Think MERN, Next.js, TypeScript, Firebase, Prisma, and Tailwind ‚Äî a perfect blend of performance and aesthetics. I've worked with powerful state tools like Redux Toolkit and Zustand, implemented secure JWT auth, and handled real-time magic with Socket.io.

üìä I also explore Data Science fundamentals, with experience in Power BI, NumPy, and EDA using Python. Visualization, for me, is where code meets storytelling.

üöÄ I‚Äôve contributed to communities like Geekroom & GDG MSIT, where I serve as Deputy Head of Development. Mentorship, teamwork, and hackathons fuel my growth.

üí¨ Always open to exciting collaborations, freelance gigs, and open source missions. Let‚Äôs build something that matters!
