# ✨ My Dev Dojo – The OG Portfolio

Welcome to **My Dev Dojo** – the one where it all began!  
This is my **first-ever developer portfolio**, built using **React.js** and styled with the magic of **Tailwind CSS**. It's not perfect, but it's got that nostalgic charm and battle scars from my early coding days. 🚀

> ⚠️ Disclaimer: This portfolio is around a year old". Still live, still proud!

This portfolio is a piece of my dev history, but it's not the end of the story. A shiny new version is probably cooking or already in the works. But this? This is my OG badge of honor. 🏅
